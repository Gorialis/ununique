Most Discord bots operate by just copying the features every other bot has and, by god, you're wrong if you think this one's any different.

This bot implements all the features exclusively available on every goddamn bot you'll ever use in your life, and not anything more.

It's licensed with a [permissive license](LICENSE) so you can copy the code all willy-nilly, as if anyone will tell the damn difference.

## Usage

If you haven't already succumbed to [fatigue](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+the+symptoms+of+software+poisoning&uact=5) from reading this many words, here's how you can do your part to dissolve any trace of meaningful creative development into the kitchen sink of monotonous grey:

1. Install the requirements using pip:
```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

2. Copy [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml) to `config.toml` and put in your token:
```toml
token = "Your.DiscordBot.TokenHere"
```

3. Run the bot:
```bash
python3 run.py
```

If you've done everything correctly, you should be foaming at the mouth, complacent in the cognizance that if you had done it all yourself, it probably would have been just like this anyway.

## Commands

You already know all of them.
